# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This project is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, with each player taking turns placing their mark (X or O) in an empty square. The first player to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.

The game is implemented using a simple HTML table to represent the grid. Each square in the grid is represented by a table cell, and each player's mark is represented by a simple text node. The CSS styles the table and the table cells to give the game a classic Tic-Tac-Toe look.

The JavaScript handles the game logic, such as checking for a winner, switching turns, and disabling squares that have already been marked. The JavaScript also implements a simple AI player that can play against the human player.

To play the game:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Click on a square to place your mark.
The AI player will then place its mark.
Continue playing until one player gets three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal.
