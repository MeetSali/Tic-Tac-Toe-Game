# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a straightforward version of the popular game Tic-Tac-Toe. Each player takes turns placing their mark (X or O) in an open square on a 3x3 grid to play the game. The game is won by the first person to get three of their markers in a line, column or diagonal.
